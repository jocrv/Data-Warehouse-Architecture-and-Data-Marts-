Concepts of Business Intelligence, Data Warehouse, Data Mart 
In this place we are presently busy basic concepts about business intelligence in the ways to analyze it in the system Suport and the system of the decision support. 
Goals: This English the difference between system of support operation support in the system of the decision support the concept Of Dataware House/ Data Mart in the concept how this concert origins.
It's before we start the study about data warehouse we need to know a few are listening before business intelligence or BI the BI are respect On intelligent to applicate on business. What does this mean? The increase of interprise reveals challenges. Related to acknowledgement. On the On business. And mood it could influence directly or undirectly the healthy From the enterprise from manager from organization take the decisions more likely directly focus on text to be better from activities Of development. In minimizing risk Which could impact the result.
In the way the platform of business intelligence supports the cricket to acknowledge to take decisions Hey unavailable information which will give you support to the seniors This group of pets results one environment and like environment with information to manager in Which happened and we'll happen enterprise it will be happen on future.
Example 1: tosome supermarket manager realixxe the analysis of was happend and identify what is the products sold at summer, is necessary analyse the last years on months with product or more sale From the December at March. If the same manager Compliment the stay off product to the stock Hey for sale finish of example Hey will happen could reveal in future So it's possible one like the project buy it by Customers and do the profile of consuming products adaptable to this profile my pet The product wire it is possible for a interest some products related for best buyers type of analyzer diagnosis discreet Prescriptive preset
According to group Gartner Group, Gartner, 2020 Below.
diagnostic analysis:  Exams that from past how this is happen? Character requests about some projects Product sales on summer for example Superman
descriptive analysis: Exam the data to reply questions about what is happen or what's going on for example this is the Weekly on sale past.

predictive analysis: using techniques from mineration data and based on data in past to reply some questions about what will happen?
Prescriptive analysis: determine action What you gonna do to save some product from sector in personal hygiene using graphic and Simulation precision and complex event. Neutral networks and machine learning 
The form of data analysis is linked to the organization's objectives, the objective is to visualize the relevant data to facilitate decision making. Now let's get to know what a decision support system is and go deeper:
Data warehouse according to Laudon (2014) two thousand and fourteen the objective of a GIS management information system is an organization to achieve operational excellence, develop new products, services and business models, strengthen relationships with customers and suppliers, improve decision-making. competitive advantage and survival the management information system makes reports available to users at levels, levels, at the level of managers who have more specific goals. Decision support systems, on the other hand, are based on knowledge that support decision-making in organizations, with analysis tools and vision from different analysis perspectives, they process large volumes of data, consolidate and provide analytical environments with queries in the format of reports and dashboards
There is also an executive information system for decision-making by company executives. Your reviews are more summarized and the review interface is easier to use and straightforward. The three types of these management information themes are intended to support decision making. Each one aimed at a specific audience. The dataware House is a management information system focused on supporting decision-making that is normally carried out by the organization's managers. The dataware House or data storage concept emerged between the nineteen eighty-nineteen nineteen-ninety years from the work developed by researchers Berry Beverly and Paul Murphy named business data warehouse that integrate data to support analytics on an organization's data.
Although Bill Inmon already used the term dataware House in the nineteen seventies or article excited the problem to be solved and the solution to be implemented for enterprise data integration. Chemist later spread the concept of data where house and today is known as the father of the Data Wear House of W. Professor Ralf Kimble is also a reference in the concept of DW date. And it developed an implementation approach different from the approach presented at the very least.
The top-down approach is part of a framework that broadly covers the issues contained in an organization. of W e from this vision today date death DN are drawn the DM will be detailed in the next topic the approach of kimble bo Up. Boton Up is dedicated to creating smaller visions with the data martes. DM. And then integrate these modules resulting in DW. Organization Figure one presents the approaches defended by the two authors. 
Top down approach of DW car rental company rent DM or sell DN. // Button up approach Quimbal DW car rental, rent DM, sell or sell DM. 
The choice of approach to be implemented by an organization depends on its need for analysis. However, often the button up approach. It is chosen because it is easier to implement. Exploring one subject at a time evolving with the two data mars development until you get the desired data wear house in the next topic the detailed data mart concept for a better understanding of the cited approaches.
Data Marts: Mars DM. DM is a data warehouse focused on an organization's subject. It is a subset of a data warehouse. The Dataware is formed by several DMs linked by common analytics perspectives. For faster implementation of the analytics environment it can be built by Data Mars. in this case it is important to understand the data mars as part of a whole DW that will be integrated with the other subjects providing analysis for the entire organization. Note the car rental ana scenario below. In order to provide an excellent service to its customers, a car rental company maintains a portfolio of zero kilometers vehicles with up to one year of use to rent to its customers. Upon completing one year of use, vehicles are sold and new vehicles are purchased for replacement. For profits and customer loyalty by offering benefits on your rentals. The rental company wants to know which customers have rented a vehicle in the last six months at least once a month
graphs: rent DM, customers loyal to the last six months. Reference month July two thousand and twenty. Customer John rental amount three, thirty-five. Client José, number of rents, thirty-two. Mary twenty-eight.
for this, an analysis environment was built with the Datamark. Rent DM making it possible to answer the question about customers. Over time, did you feel the need to answer another question, do customers who bought cars with us participate in the loyalty program? To answer this question, the DM, sale, DM was built. DM chart, used vehicle sales, reference month July two thousand and twenty. Customer José. Sales value of the vehicle. Ninety thousand reais. Customer Ana vehicle sales value. Fifty thousand Joaquim customer. Vehicle sales value forty-five thousand. Datamarte sale DM has the same analysis perspective as Datamarte rent DM this perspective is the view of a customer with the perspective of unusual in the two DM it is possible to relate them and analyze the information of rental and sale of vehicles for customers from the rental company.
